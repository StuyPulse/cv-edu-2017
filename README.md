## CV Education for the 2017 season

OpenCV needs to be installed at `lib/opencv-3.0.0`.

On Linux, you can install OpenCV with the `install-opencv-unix.sh` script. There
are more detailed instructions on this in the README of
[https://github.com/Team694/stuyvision-lib]()). Once CV is setup, run `ant` to
compile and run the project. (Apache Ant must be installed.)

To use on Windows, see `windows-setup.md` for instructions.
